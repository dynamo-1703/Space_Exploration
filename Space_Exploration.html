                        An aircraft (pl.: aircraft) is a vehicle that is able to fly by gaining support from the air. It
                        counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or the dynamic lift of an airfoil,[1]
                        or, in a few cases, direct downward thrust from its engines. Common examples of aircraft include
                        airplanes, helicopters, airships (including blimps), gliders, paramotors, and hot air
                        balloons.[2]
                        The human activity that surrounds aircraft is called aviation. The science of aviation,
                        including designing and building aircraft, is called aeronautics. Crewed aircraft are flown by
                        an onboard pilot, whereas unmanned aerial vehicles may be remotely controlled or self-controlled
                        by onboard computers. Aircraft may be classified by different criteria, such as lift type,
                        aircraft propulsion (if any), usage and others.
                        Lighter-than-air aircraft or aerostats use buoyancy to float in the air in much the same way
                        that ships float on the water. They are characterized by one or more large cells or canopies,
                        filled with a lifting gas such as helium, hydrogen or hot air, which is less dense than the
                        surrounding air. When the weight of the lifting gas is added to the weight of the aircraft
                        itself, it is same or less than the mass of the air that the craft displaces.
                        Small hot-air balloons, called sky lanterns, were first invented in ancient China prior to the
                        3rd century BC and used primarily in cultural celebrations, and were only the second type of
                        aircraft to fly, the first being kites, which were also first invented in ancient China over two
                        thousand years ago (see Han Dynasty).
                        A balloon was originally any aerostat, while the term airship was used for large, powered
                        aircraft designs — usually fixed-wing.[3][4][5][6][7][8] In 1919, Frederick Handley Page was
                        reported as referring to "ships of the air," with smaller passenger types as "Air yachts."[9] In
                        the 1930s, large intercontinental flying boats were also sometimes referred to as "ships of the
                        air" or "flying-ships".[10][11] — though none had yet been built. The advent of powered
                        balloons, called dirigible balloons, and later of rigid hulls allowing a great increase in size,
                        began to change the way these words were used. Huge powered aerostats, characterized by a rigid
                        outer framework and separate aerodynamic skin surrounding the gas bags, were produced, the
                        Zeppelins being the largest and most famous. There were still no fixed-wing aircraft or
                        non-rigid balloons large enough to be called airships, so "airship" came to be synonymous with
                        these aircraft. Then several accidents, such as the Hindenburg disaster in 1937, led to the
                        demise of these airships. Nowadays a "balloon" is an unpowered aerostat and an "airship" is a
                        powered one.
                        Heavier-than-air aircraft or aerodynes are denser than air and thus must find some way to obtain
                        enough lift that can overcome the aircraft's weight. There are two ways to produce dynamic
                        upthrust — aerodynamic lift by having air flowing past an aerofoil (such dynamic interaction of
                        aerofoils with air is the origin of the term "aerodyne"), or powered lift in the form of
                        reactional lift from downward engine thrust.
                        Aerodynamic lift involving wings is the most common, and can be achieved via two methods.
                        Fixed-wing aircraft (airplanes and gliders) achieve airflow past the wings by having the entire
                        aircraft moving forward through the air, while rotorcraft (helicopters and autogyros) do so by
                        having mobile, elongated wings spinning rapidly around a mast in an assembly known as the rotor.
                        As aerofoils, there must be air flowing over the wing to create pressure difference between
                        above and below, thus generating upward lift over the entire wetted area of the wing. A flexible
                        wing is a wing made of fabric or thin sheet material, often stretched over a rigid frame,
                        similar to the flight membranes on many flying and gliding animals. A kite is tethered to the
                        ground and relies on the speed of the wind over its wings, which may be flexible or rigid,
                        fixed, or rotary.
                        With powered lift, the aircraft directs its engine thrust vertically downward. V/STOL aircraft,
                        such as the Harrier jump jet and Lockheed Martin F-35B take off and land vertically using
                        powered lift and transfer to aerodynamic lift in steady flight.
                        A pure rocket is not usually regarded as an aerodyne because its flight does not depend on
                        interaction with the air at all (and thus can even fly in the vacuum of outer space); however,
                        many aerodynamic lift vehicles have been powered or assisted by rocket motors
                        A powered, steerable aerostat is called a dirigible. Sometimes this term is applied only to
                        non-rigid balloons, and sometimes dirigible balloon is regarded as the definition of an airship
                        (which may then be rigid or non-rigid). Non-rigid dirigibles are characterized by a moderately
                        aerodynamic gasbag with stabilizing fins at the back. These soon became known as blimps. During
                        World War II, this shape was widely adopted for tethered balloons; in windy weather, this both
                        reduces the strain on the tether and stabilizes the balloon. The nickname blimp was adopted
                        along with the shape. In modern times, any small dirigible or airship is called a blimp, though
                        a blimp may be unpowered as well as powered.

                            <h2>Mission Background</h2>
                            A 1960s proposal for a Grand Tour to study the outer planets led NASA to begin work on a
                            mission during the early 1970s.[15] Information gathered by the Pioneer 10 spacecraft helped
                            engineers design Voyager to better cope with the intense radiation around Jupiter.[16]
                            Still, shortly before launch, strips of kitchen-grade aluminum foil were applied to certain
                            cables to improve radiation shielding.[17]
                            Initially, Voyager 1 was planned as Mariner 11 of the Mariner program. Due to budget cuts,
                            the mission was reduced to a flyby of Jupiter and Saturn and renamed the Mariner
                            Jupiter-Saturn probes. The name was changed to Voyager when the probe designs began to
                            differ substantially from Mariner missions.[18]
                            <h2>Spacecraft components</h2>
                            Voyager 1 was built by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). It has 16 hydrazine thrusters,
                            three-axis stabilization gyroscopes, and referencing instruments to keep the probe's radio
                            antenna pointed toward Earth. Collectively, these instruments are part of the Attitude and
                            Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS), along with redundant units of most instruments and
                            eight backup thrusters.[19] The spacecraft also included 11 scientific instruments to study
                            celestial objects such as planets as it travels through space.[20]
                            <h4>1. Communication system</h4>
                            The radio communication system of Voyager 1 was designed to be used up to and beyond the
                            limits of the Solar System. It has a 3.7-metre (12 ft) diameter high-gain Cassegrain antenna
                            to send and receive radio waves via the three Deep Space Network stations on the Earth.[21]
                            The spacecraft normally transmits data to Earth over Deep Space Network Channel 18, using a
                            frequency of either 2.3 GHz or 8.4 GHz, while signals from Earth to Voyager are transmitted
                            at 2.1 GHz.[22]
                            When Voyager 1 is unable to communicate with the Earth, its digital tape recorder (DTR) can
                            record about 67 megabytes of data for later transmission.[23] As of 2023, signals from
                            Voyager 1 take more than 22 hours to reach Earth.[4]
                            <h4>2. Power</h4>
                            Voyager 1 has three radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) mounted on a boom. Each
                            MHW-RTG contains 24 pressed plutonium-238 oxide spheres.[24] The RTGs generated about 470 W
                            of electric power at the time of launch, with the remainder being dissipated as waste
                            heat.[25] The power output of the RTGs declines over time due to the 87.7-year half-life of
                            the fuel and degradation of the thermocouples, but they will continue to support some of its
                            operations until at least 2025

                        MERCURY
                        <div class="info" style="display: none;">
                            Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest in the Solar System. In English,
                            it is named after the ancient Roman god Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce and
                            communication, and the messenger of the gods. Mercury is classified as a terrestrial planet,
                            with roughly the same surface gravity as Mars. The surface of Mercury is heavily cratered,
                            as a result of countless impact events that have accumulated over billions of years. Its
                            largest crater, Caloris Planitia, has a diameter of 1,550 km (960 mi), which is about
                            one-third the diameter of the planet (4,880 km or 3,030 mi). Similarly to the Earth's Moon,
                            Mercury's surface displays an expansive rupes system generated from thrust faults and bright
                            ray systems formed by impact event remnants.
                            Mercury's sidereal year (88.0 Earth days) and sidereal day (58.65 Earth days) are in a 3:2
                            ratio. This relationship is called spin–orbit resonance, and sidereal here means "relative
                            to the stars". Consequently, one solar day (sunrise to sunrise) on Mercury lasts for around
                            176 Earth days: twice the planet's sidereal year. This means that one side of Mercury will
                            remain in sunlight for one Mercurian year of 88 Earth days; while during the next orbit,
                            that side will be in darkness all the time until the next sunrise after another 88 Earth
                            days.
                            Combined with its high orbital eccentricity, the planet's surface has widely varying
                            sunlight intensity and temperature, with the equatorial regions ranging from −170 °C (−270
                            °F) at night to 420 °C (790 °F) during sunlight. Due to the very small axial tilt, the
                            planet's poles are permanently shadowed. This strongly suggests that water ice could be
                            present in the craters. Above the planet's surface is an extremely tenuous exosphere and a
                            faint magnetic field that is strong enough to deflect solar winds. Mercury has no natural
                            satellite.
                            As of the early 2020s, many broad details of Mercury's geological history are still under
                            investigation or pending data from space probes. Like other planets in the Solar System,
                            Mercury was formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago. Its mantle is highly homogeneous,
                            which suggests that Mercury had a magma ocean early in its history, like the Moon. According
                            to current models, Mercury may have a solid silicate crust and mantle overlying a solid
                            outer core, a deeper liquid core layer, and a solid inner core. There are many competing
                            hypotheses about Mercury's origins and development, some of which incorporate collision with
                            planetesimals and rock vaporization.
                            Nomenclature
                            Historically, humans knew Mercury by different names depending on whether it was an evening
                            star or a morning star. By about 350 BC, the ancient Greeks had realized the two stars were
                            one.[20] They knew the planet as Στίλβων Stilbōn, meaning "twinkling", and Ἑρμής Hermēs, for
                            its fleeting motion,[21] a name that is retained in modern Greek (Ερμής Ermis).[22] The
                            Romans named the planet after the swift-footed Roman messenger god, Mercury (Latin
                            Mercurius), whom they equated with the Greek Hermes, because it moves across the sky faster
                            than any other planet,[20][23] though some associated the planet with Apollo instead, as
                            detailed by Pliny the Elder.[24] The astronomical symbol for Mercury is a stylized version
                            of Hermes' caduceus; a Christian cross was added in the 16th century:☿.[25][26]
                            Mercury is one of four terrestrial planets in the Solar System, which means it is a rocky
                            body like Earth. It is the smallest planet in the Solar System, with an equatorial radius of
                            2,439.7 kilometres (1,516.0 mi).[4] Mercury is also smaller—albeit more massive—than the
                            largest natural satellites in the Solar System, Ganymede and Titan. Mercury consists of
                            approximately 70% metallic and 30% silicate material.[27]

                        VENUS
                        <div class="info" style="display: none;">
                            Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is a terrestrial planet and is the closest in
                            mass and size to its orbital neighbour Earth. Venus has by far the densest atmosphere of the
                            terrestrial planets, composed mostly of carbon dioxide with a thick, global sulfuric acid
                            cloud cover. At the surface it has a mean temperature of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F) and a
                            pressure 92 times that of Earth's at sea level. These extreme conditions compress carbon
                            dioxide into a supercritical state at Venus's surface.
                            Internally, Venus has a core, mantle, and crust. Venus lacks an internal dynamo, and its
                            weakly induced magnetosphere is caused by atmospheric interactions with the solar wind.
                            Internal heat escapes through active volcanism,[21][22] resulting in resurfacing instead of
                            plate tectonics. Venus is one of two planets in the Solar System, the other being Mercury,
                            that have no moons.[23] Conditions perhaps favourable for life on Venus have been identified
                            at its cloud layers. Venus may have had liquid surface water early in its history with a
                            habitable environment,[24][25] before a runaway greenhouse effect evaporated any water and
                            turned Venus into its present state.[26][27][28]
                            The rotation of Venus has been slowed and turned against its orbital direction (retrograde)
                            by the currents and drag of its atmosphere.[29] It takes 224.7 Earth days for Venus to
                            complete an orbit around the Sun, and a Venusian solar year is just under two Venusian days
                            long. The orbits of Venus and Earth are the closest between any two Solar System planets,
                            approaching each other in synodic periods of 1.6 years. Venus and Earth have the lowest
                            difference in gravitational potential of any pair of Solar System planets. This allows Venus
                            to be the most accessible destination and a useful gravity assist waypoint for
                            interplanetary flights from Earth.
                            Venus figures prominently in human culture and in the history of astronomy. Orbiting
                            inferiorly (inside of Earth's orbit), it always appears close to the Sun in Earth's sky, as
                            either a "morning star" or an "evening star". While this is also true for Mercury, Venus
                            appears more prominent, since it is the third brightest object in Earth's sky after the Moon
                            and the Sun.[30][31] In 1961, Venus became the target of the first interplanetary flight,
                            Venera 1, followed by many essential interplanetary firsts, such as the first soft landing
                            on another planet by Venera 7 in 1970. These probes demonstrated the extreme surface
                            conditions, an insight that has informed predictions about global warming on Earth.[32] This
                            finding ended the theories and then popular science fiction about Venus being a habitable or
                            inhabited planet.
                            Venus is one of the four terrestrial planets in the Solar System, meaning that it is a rocky
                            body like Earth. It is similar to Earth in size and mass and is often described as Earth's
                            "sister" or "twin".[33] Venus is close to spherical due to its slow rotation.[34] Venus has
                            a diameter of 12,103.6 km (7,520.8 mi)—only 638.4 km (396.7 mi) less than Earth's—and its
                            mass is 81.5% of Earth's, making it the third-smallest planet in the Solar System.
                            Conditions on the Venusian surface differ radically from those on Earth because its dense
                            atmosphere is 96.5% carbon dioxide, with most of the remaining 3.5% being nitrogen.[35] The
                            surface pressure is 9.3 megapascals (93 bars), and the average surface temperature is 737 K
                            (464 °C; 867 °F), above the critical points of both major constituents and making the
                            surface atmosphere a supercritical fluid out of mainly supercritical carbon dioxide and some
                            supercritical nitrogen.

                        <div class="info" style="display: none;">
                            Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor
                            life. This is enabled by Earth being an ocean world, the only one in the Solar System
                            sustaining liquid surface water. Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global
                            ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's crust. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust is land, most
                            of which is located in the form of continental landmasses within Earth's land hemisphere.
                            Most of Earth's land is at least somewhat humid and covered by vegetation, while large
                            sheets of ice at Earth's polar deserts retain more water than Earth's groundwater, lakes,
                            rivers and atmospheric water combined. Earth's crust consists of slowly moving tectonic
                            plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth has a
                            liquid outer core that generates a magnetosphere capable of deflecting most of the
                            destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation.
                            Earth has a dynamic atmosphere, which sustains Earth's surface conditions and protects it
                            from most meteoroids and UV-light at entry. It has a composition of primarily nitrogen and
                            oxygen. Water vapor is widely present in the atmosphere, forming clouds that cover most of
                            the planet. The water vapor acts as a greenhouse gas and, together with other greenhouse
                            gases in the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), creates the conditions for both
                            liquid surface water and water vapor to persist via the capturing of energy from the Sun's
                            light. This process maintains the current average surface temperature of 14.76 °C (58.57
                            °F), at which water is liquid under normal atmospheric pressure. Differences in the amount
                            of captured energy between geographic regions (as with the equatorial region receiving more
                            sunlight than the polar regions) drive atmospheric and ocean currents, producing a global
                            climate system with different climate regions, and a range of weather phenomena such as
                            precipitation, allowing components such as nitrogen to cycle.
                            Earth is rounded into an ellipsoid with a circumference of about 40,000 km. It is the
                            densest planet in the Solar System. Of the four rocky planets, it is the largest and most
                            massive. Earth is about eight light-minutes away from the Sun and orbits it, taking a year
                            (about 365.25 days) to complete one revolution. Earth rotates around its own axis in
                            slightly less than a day (in about 23 hours and 56 minutes). Earth's axis of rotation is
                            tilted with respect to the perpendicular to its orbital plane around the Sun, producing
                            seasons. Earth is orbited by one permanent natural satellite, the Moon, which orbits Earth
                            at 384,400 km (1.28 light seconds) and is roughly a quarter as wide as Earth. The Moon's
                            gravity helps stabilize Earth's axis, causes tides and gradually slows Earth's rotation.
                            Tidal locking has made the Moon always face Earth with the same side.
                            Earth, like most other bodies in the Solar System, formed 4.5 billion years ago from gas and
                            dust in the early Solar System. During the first billion years of Earth's history, the ocean
                            formed and then life developed within it. Life spread globally and has been altering Earth's
                            atmosphere and surface, leading to the Great Oxidation Event two billion years ago. Humans
                            emerged 300,000 years ago in Africa and have spread across every continent on Earth. Humans
                            depend on Earth's biosphere and natural resources for their survival, but have increasingly
                            impacted the planet's environment. Humanity's current impact on Earth's climate and
                            biosphere is unsustainable, threatening the livelihood of humans and many other forms of
                            life, and causing widespread extinctions.[23]

                        MARS
                        <div class="info" style="display: none;">
                            Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. The surface of Mars is orange-red because it is
                            covered in iron(III) oxide dust, giving it the nickname "the Red Planet".[22][23] Mars is
                            among the brightest objects in Earth's sky, and its high-contrast albedo features have made
                            it a common subject for telescope viewing. It is classified as a terrestrial planet and is
                            the second smallest of the Solar System's planets with a diameter of 6,779 km (4,212 mi). In
                            terms of orbital motion, a Martian solar day (sol) is equal to 24.6 hours, and a Martian
                            solar year is equal to 1.88 Earth years (687 Earth days). Mars has two natural satellites
                            that are small and irregular in shape: Phobos and Deimos.
                            The relatively flat plains in northern parts of Mars strongly contrast with the cratered
                            terrain in southern highlands – this terrain observation is known as the Martian dichotomy.
                            Mars hosts many enormous extinct volcanoes (the tallest is Olympus Mons, 21.9 km or 13.6 mi
                            tall) and one of the largest canyons in the Solar System (Valles Marineris, 4,000 km or
                            2,500 mi long). Geologically, the planet is fairly active with marsquakes trembling
                            underneath the ground, dust devils sweeping across the landscape, and cirrus clouds. Carbon
                            dioxide is substantially present in Mars's polar ice caps and thin atmosphere. During a
                            year, there are large surface temperature swings on the surface between −78.5 °C (−109.3 °F)
                            to 5.7 °C (42.3 °F)[c] similar to Earth's seasons, as both planets have significant axial
                            tilt.
                            Mars was formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago. During the Noachian period (4.5 to 3.5
                            billion years ago), Mars's surface was marked by meteor impacts, valley formation, erosion,
                            and the possible presence of water oceans. The Hesperian period (3.5 to 3.3–2.9 billion
                            years ago) was dominated by widespread volcanic activity and flooding that carved immense
                            outflow channels. The Amazonian period, which continues to the present, has been marked by
                            the wind as a dominant influence on geological processes. Due to Mars's geological history,
                            the possibility of past or present life on Mars remains of great scientific interest.
                            Since the late 20th century, Mars has been explored by uncrewed spacecraft and rovers, with
                            the first flyby by the Mariner 4 probe in 1965, the first orbit by the Mars 2 probe in 1971,
                            and the first landing by the Viking 1 probe in 1976. As of 2023, there are at least 11
                            active probes orbiting Mars or on the Martian surface. Mars is an attractive target for
                            future human exploration missions, though in the 2020s no such mission is planned.
                            Scientists have theorized that during the Solar System's formation, Mars was created as the
                            result of a random process of run-away accretion of material from the protoplanetary disk
                            that orbited the Sun. Mars has many distinctive chemical features caused by its position in
                            the Solar System. Elements with comparatively low boiling points, such as chlorine,
                            phosphorus, and sulfur, are much more common on Mars than on Earth; these elements were
                            probably pushed outward by the young Sun's energetic solar wind.[24]
                            After the formation of the planets, the inner Solar System may have been subjected to the
                            so-called Late Heavy Bombardment. About 60% of the surface of Mars shows a record of impacts
                            from that era,[25][26][27] whereas much of the remaining surface is probably underlain by
                            immense impact basins caused by those events. However, more recent modeling has disputed the
                            existence of the Late Heavy Bombardment.[28] There is evidence of an enormous impact basin
                            in the Northern Hemisphere of Mars, spanning 10,600 by 8,500 kilometres (6,600 by 5,300 mi),
                            or roughly four times the size of the Moon's South Pole–Aitken basin, which would be the
                            largest impact basin yet discovered if confirmed.[29] It has been hypothesized that the
                            basin was formed when Mars was struck by a Pluto-sized body about four billion years ago.
                            The event, thought to be the cause of the Martian hemispheric dichotomy, created the smooth
                            Borealis basin that covers 40% of the planet.[30][31]
                            A 2023 study shows evidence, based on the orbital inclination of Deimos (a small moon of
                            Mars), that Mars may once have had a ring system 3.5 billion years to 4 billion years
                            ago.[32] This ring system may have been formed from a moon, 20 times more massive than
                            Phobos, orbiting Mars billions of years ago; and Phobos would be a remnant of that
                            ring.[33][34]
                            The geological history of Mars can be split into many periods, but the following are the
                            three primary periods:[35][36]
                            Noachian period: Formation of the oldest extant surfaces of Mars, 4.5 to 3.5 billion years
                            ago. Noachian age surfaces are scarred by many large impact craters. The Tharsis bulge, a
                            volcanic upland, is thought to have formed during this period, with extensive flooding by
                            liquid water late in the period. Named after Noachis Terra.[37]
                            Hesperian period: 3.5 to between 3.3 and 2.9 billion years ago. The Hesperian period is
                            marked by the formation of extensive lava plains. Named after Hesperia Planum.[37]
                            Amazonian period: between 3.3 and 2.9 billion years ago to the present. Amazonian regions
                            have few meteorite impact craters but are otherwise quite varied. Olympus Mons formed during
                            this period, with lava flows elsewhere on Mars. Named after Amazonis Planitia.[37]
                            Geological activity is still taking place on Mars. The Athabasca Valles is home to
                            sheet-like lava flows created about 200 million years ago. Water flows in the grabens called
                            the Cerberus Fossae occurred less than 20 million years ago, indicating equally recent
                            volcanic intrusions.[38] The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has captured images of
                            avalanches.[39][40]

                        JUPITER
                        <div class="info" style="display: none;">
                            Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas
                            giant with a mass more than 2.5 times that of all the other planets in the Solar System
                            combined and slightly less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Its diameter is eleven
                            times that of Earth, and a tenth that of the Sun. Jupiter orbits the Sun at a distance of
                            5.20 AU (778.5 Gm), with an orbital period of 11.86 years. It is the third-brightest natural
                            object in the Earth's night sky, after the Moon and Venus, and has been observed since
                            prehistoric times. Its name derives from that of Jupiter, the chief deity of ancient Roman
                            religion.
                            Jupiter was the first of the Sun's planets to form, and its inward migration during the
                            primordial phase of the Solar System affected much of the formation history of the other
                            planets. Jupiter's atmosphere consists of 76% hydrogen and 24% helium by mass, with a denser
                            interior. It contains trace elements and compounds like carbon, oxygen, sulfur, neon,
                            ammonia, water vapour, phosphine, hydrogen sulfide, and hydrocarbons. Jupiter's helium
                            abundance is 80% of the Sun's, similar to Saturn's composition. The ongoing contraction of
                            Jupiter's interior generates more heat than the planet receives from the Sun. Its internal
                            structure is believed to consist of an outer mantle of fluid metallic hydrogen and a diffuse
                            inner core of denser material. Because of its rapid rate of rotation, one turn in ten hours,
                            Jupiter is an oblate spheroid; it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator. The
                            outer atmosphere is divided into a series of latitudinal bands, with turbulence and storms
                            along their interacting boundaries; the most obvious result of this is the Great Red Spot, a
                            giant storm that has been recorded since 1831.
                            Jupiter's magnetic field is the strongest and second-largest contiguous structure in the
                            Solar System, generated by eddy currents within the fluid, metallic hydrogen core. The solar
                            wind interacts with the magnetosphere, extending it outward and affecting Jupiter's orbit.
                            Jupiter is surrounded by a faint system of planetary rings that were discovered in 1979 by
                            Voyager 1 and further investigated by the Galileo orbiter in the 1990s. The Jovian ring
                            system consists mainly of dust and has three main segments: an inner torus of particles
                            known as the halo, a relatively bright main ring, and an outer gossamer ring. The rings have
                            a reddish colour in visible and near-infrared light. The age of the ring system is unknown,
                            possibly dating back to Jupiter's formation.
                            At least 95 moons orbit the planet; the four largest moons—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and
                            Callisto—orbit within the magnetosphere, and were discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610.
                            Ganymede, the largest of the four, is larger than the planet Mercury. Since 1973, Jupiter
                            has been visited by nine robotic probes: seven flybys and two dedicated orbiters, with two
                            more en route.
                            In both the ancient Greek and Roman civilizations, Jupiter was named after the chief god of
                            the divine pantheon: Zeus to the Greeks and Jupiter to the Romans.[19] The International
                            Astronomical Union formally adopted the name Jupiter for the planet in 1976 and has since
                            named its newly discovered satellites for the god's lovers, favourites, and descendants.[20]
                            The planetary symbol for Jupiter, ♃, descends from a Greek zeta with a horizontal stroke,
                            ⟨Ƶ⟩, as an abbreviation for Zeus.[21][22]
                            In Latin, Iovis is the genitive case of Iuppiter, i.e. Jupiter. It is associated with the
                            etymology of Zeus ('sky father'). The English equivalent, Jove, is known to have come into
                            use as a poetic name for the planet around the 14th century.[23]
                            Jovian is the adjectival form of Jupiter. The older adjectival form jovial, employed by
                            astrologers in the Middle Ages, has come to mean 'happy' or 'merry', moods ascribed to
                            Jupiter's influence in astrology.[24]
                            The original Greek deity Zeus supplies the root zeno-, which is used to form some
                            Jupiter-related words, such as zenography.[d]

                        SATURN
                        <div class="info" style="display: none;">
                            Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest in the Solar System, after
                            Jupiter. It is a gas giant, with an average radius of about nine times that of
                            Earth.[27][28] It has an eighth the average density of Earth, but is over 95 times more
                            massive.[29][30][31] Even though Saturn is almost as big as Jupiter, Saturn has less than a
                            third its mass. Saturn orbits the Sun at a distance of 9.59 AU (1,434 million km), with an
                            orbital period of 29.45 years.
                            Saturn's interior is thought to be composed of a rocky core, surrounded by a deep layer of
                            metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and an outer
                            layer of gas. Saturn has a pale yellow hue, due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere.
                            An electrical current in the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's
                            planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's, but has a magnetic moment 580 times
                            that of Earth because of Saturn's greater size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is about a
                            twentieth that of Jupiter.[32] The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in
                            contrast, although long-lived features can appear. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1,800
                            kilometres per hour (1,100 miles per hour).
                            The planet has a bright and extensive system of rings, composed mainly of ice particles,
                            with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. At least 146 moons[33] orbit the planet, of
                            which 63 are officially named; these do not include the hundreds of moonlets in the rings.
                            Titan, Saturn's largest moon and the second largest in the Solar System, is larger (and less
                            massive) than the planet Mercury and is the only moon in the Solar System that has a
                            substantial atmosphere.[34]
                            Saturn is a gas giant, composed predominantly of hydrogen and helium. It lacks a definite
                            surface, though it is likely to have a solid core.[37] The planet's rotation makes it an
                            oblate spheroid—a ball flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator. Its equatorial
                            radius is more than 10% larger than the polar radius: 60,268 km versus 54,364 km (37,449 mi
                            versus 33,780 mi).[6] Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune, the other giant planets in the Solar
                            System, are less oblate. The combination of the bulge and the rotation rate means that the
                            effective surface gravity along the equator, 8.96 m/s2, is 74% of what it is at the poles
                            and is lower than the surface gravity of Earth. However, the equatorial escape velocity,
                            nearly 36 km/s, is much higher than that of Earth.[38]
                            Saturn is the only planet of the Solar System that is less dense than water—about 30%
                            less.[39] Although Saturn's core is considerably denser than water, the average specific
                            density of the planet is 0.69 g/cm3, because of the atmosphere. Jupiter has 318 times
                            Earth's mass,[40] and Saturn is 95 times Earth's mass.[6] Together, Jupiter and Saturn hold
                            92% of the total planetary mass in the Solar System.[41]

                        URANUS
                        <div class="info" style="display: none;">
                            Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It is a gaseous cyan-coloured ice giant. Most of
                            the planet is made of water, ammonia, and methane in a supercritical phase of matter, which
                            astronomy calls "ice" or volatiles. The planet's atmosphere has a complex layered cloud
                            structure and has the lowest minimum temperature (49 K (−224 °C; −371 °F)) of all the Solar
                            System's planets. It has a marked axial tilt of 82.23° with a retrograde rotation period of
                            17 hours and 14 minutes. This means that in an 84-Earth-year orbital period around the Sun,
                            its poles get around 42 years of continuous sunlight, followed by 42 years of continuous
                            darkness.
                            Uranus has the third-largest diameter and fourth-largest mass among the Solar System's
                            planets. Based on current models, inside its volatile mantle layer is a rocky core, and
                            surrounding it is a thick hydrogen and helium atmosphere. Trace amounts of hydrocarbons
                            (thought to be produced via hydrolysis) and carbon monoxide along with carbon dioxide
                            (thought to have been originated from comets) have been detected in the upper atmosphere.
                            There are many unexplained climate phenomena in Uranus's atmosphere, such as its peak wind
                            speed of 900 km/h (560 mph),[23] variations in its polar cap, and its erratic cloud
                            formation. The planet also has very low internal heat compared to other giant planets, the
                            cause of which remains unclear.
                            Like the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system, a magnetosphere, and many natural
                            satellites. The extremely dark ring system reflects only about 2% of the incoming light.
                            Uranus's 28 natural satellites include 18 known regular moons, of which 13 are small inner
                            moons. Further out are the larger five major moons of the planet: Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel,
                            Titania, and Oberon. Orbiting at a much greater distance from Uranus are the ten known
                            irregular moons. The planet's magnetosphere is highly asymmetric and has many charged
                            particles, which may be the cause of the darkening of its rings and moons.
                            Uranus is visible to the naked eye, but it is very dim and was not classified as a planet
                            until 1781, when it was first observed by William Herschel. About seven decades after its
                            discovery, consensus was reached that the planet be named after the Greek god Uranus
                            (Ouranos), one of the Greek primordial deities. As of 2024, it had been visited up close
                            only once when in 1986 the Voyager 2 probe flew by the planet.[24] Though nowadays it can be
                            resolved and observed by telescopes, there is much desire to revisit the planet, as shown by
                            Planetary Science Decadal Survey's decision to make the proposed Uranus Orbiter and Probe
                            mission a top priority in the 2023–2032 survey, and the CNSA's proposal to fly by the planet
                            with a subprobe of Tianwen-4.[25]
                            Like the classical planets, Uranus is visible to the naked eye, but it was never recognised
                            as a planet by ancient observers because of its dimness and slow orbit.[26] William Herschel
                            first observed Uranus on 13 March 1781, leading to its discovery as a planet, expanding the
                            known boundaries of the Solar System for the first time in history and making Uranus the
                            first planet classified as such with the aid of a telescope. The discovery of Uranus also
                            effectively doubled the size of the known Solar System because Uranus is around twice the
                            distance from the Sun as the planet Saturn.

                        <div class="info" style="display: none;">
                            Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun. It is the fourth-largest
                            planet in the Solar System by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant
                            planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth. Compared to its fellow ice giant Uranus, Neptune
                            is slightly more massive, but denser and smaller. Being composed primarily of gases and
                            liquids,[21] it has no well-defined solid surface, and orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years
                            at an orbital distance of 30.1 astronomical units (4.5 billion kilometres; 2.8 billion
                            miles). It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol ♆,
                            representing Neptune's trident.[e]
                            Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System that
                            was not initially observed by direct empirical observation. Rather, unexpected changes in
                            the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to hypothesise that its orbit was subject to
                            gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. After Bouvard's death, the position of
                            Neptune was mathematically predicted from his observations, independently, by John Couch
                            Adams and Urbain Le Verrier. Neptune was subsequently directly observed with a telescope on
                            23 September 1846[2] by Johann Gottfried Galle within a degree of the position predicted by
                            Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the
                            planet's remaining moons were located telescopically until the 20th century.
                            The planet's distance from Earth gives it a small apparent size, and its distance from the
                            Sun renders it very dim, making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes. Only
                            the advent of the Hubble Space Telescope and of large ground-based telescopes with adaptive
                            optics allowed for detailed observations. Neptune was visited by Voyager 2, which flew by
                            the planet on 25 August 1989; Voyager 2 remains the only spacecraft to have visited
                            it.[22][23] Like the gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn), Neptune's atmosphere is composed
                            primarily of hydrogen and helium, along with traces of hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen,
                            but contains a higher proportion of ices such as water, ammonia and methane. Similar to
                            Uranus, its interior is primarily composed of ices and rock;[24] both planets are normally
                            considered "ice giants" to distinguish them.[25] Along with Rayleigh scattering, traces of
                            methane in the outermost regions make Neptune appear faintly blue.[26][27]
                            In contrast to the strongly seasonal atmosphere of Uranus, which can be featureless for long
                            periods of time, Neptune's atmosphere has active and consistently visible weather patterns.
                            At the time of the Voyager 2 flyby in 1989, the planet's southern hemisphere had a Great
                            Dark Spot comparable to the Great Red Spot on Jupiter. In 2018, a newer main dark spot and
                            smaller dark spot were identified and studied.[28] These weather patterns are driven by the
                            strongest sustained winds of any planet in the Solar System, as high as 2,100 km/h (580 m/s;
                            1,300 mph).[29] Because of its great distance from the Sun, Neptune's outer atmosphere is
                            one of the coldest places in the Solar System, with temperatures at its cloud tops
                            approaching 55 K (−218 °C; −361 °F). Temperatures at the planet's centre are approximately
                            5,400 K (5,100 °C; 9,300 °F).[30][31] Neptune has a faint and fragmented ring system
                            (labelled "arcs"), discovered in 1984 and confirmed by Voyager 2.[32]
                            Neptune's mass of 1.0243×1026 kg[8] is intermediate between Earth and the larger gas giants:
                            it is 17 times that of Earth but just 1/19th that of Jupiter.[g] Its gravity at 1 bar is
                            11.15 m/s2, 1.14 times the surface gravity of Earth,[71] and surpassed only by Jupiter.[72]
                            Neptune's equatorial radius of 24,764 km[11] is nearly four times that of Earth. Neptune,
                            like Uranus, is an ice giant, a subclass of giant planet, because they are smaller and have
                            higher concentrations of volatiles than Jupiter and Saturn.[73] In the search for
                            exoplanets, Neptune has been used as a metonym: discovered bodies of similar mass are often
                            referred to as "Neptunes",[74] just as scientists refer to various extrasolar bodies as
                            "Jupiters".

                            Pluto (minor-planet designation: 134340 Pluto) is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring
                            of bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. It is the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known
                            object to directly orbit the Sun. It is the largest known trans-Neptunian object by volume,
                            by a small margin, but is less massive than Eris. Like other Kuiper belt objects, Pluto is
                            made primarily of ice and rock and is much smaller than the inner planets. Pluto has roughly
                            one-sixth the mass of the Moon, and one-third its volume.
                            Pluto has a moderately eccentric and inclined orbit, ranging from 30 to 49 astronomical
                            units (4.5 to 7.3 billion kilometres; 2.8 to 4.6 billion miles) from the Sun. Light from the
                            Sun takes 5.5 hours to reach Pluto at its orbital distance of 39.5 AU (5.91 billion km; 3.67
                            billion mi). Pluto's eccentric orbit periodically brings it closer to the Sun than Neptune,
                            but a stable orbital resonance prevents them from colliding.
                            Pluto has five known moons: Charon, the largest, whose diameter is just over half that of
                            Pluto; Styx; Nix; Kerberos; and Hydra. Pluto and Charon are sometimes considered a binary
                            system because the barycenter of their orbits does not lie within either body, and they are
                            tidally locked. New Horizons was the first spacecraft to visit Pluto and its moons, making a
                            flyby on July 14, 2015, and taking detailed measurements and observations.
                            Pluto was discovered in 1930 by Clyde W. Tombaugh, making it by far the first known object
                            in the Kuiper belt. It was immediately hailed as the ninth planet. However,[15]: 27  its
                            planetary status was questioned when it was found to be much smaller than expected. These
                            doubts increased following the discovery of additional objects in the Kuiper belt starting
                            in the 1990s, and particularly the more massive scattered disk object Eris in 2005. In 2006,
                            the International Astronomical Union (IAU) formally redefined the term planet to exclude
                            dwarf planets such as Pluto. Many planetary astronomers, however, continue to consider Pluto
                            and other dwarf planets to be planets.

                                Our Milky Way is one example of a broad class of galaxies defined by the presence of spiral
                                arms. These galaxies resemble giant rotating pinwheels with a pancake-like disk of stars and
                                a
                                central bulge or tight concentration of stars.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The spiral arms can be wound tightly or loosely, and some cannot be seen from Earth because
                                we
                                view the galaxy from the side, edge on.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A perfectly circular image will be an E0 galaxy, while a flatter object might be an E7
                                galaxy. (As explained above, elliptical galaxies are never flatter than this, so there are
                                no E8, E9, or E10 galaxies.)
    
                                Although the above-cited criteria are generally accepted, current high-quality measurements
                                have shown that some significant deviations exist. Most elliptical galaxies do not, for
                                instance, exactly fit the intensity law formulated by Hubble; deviations are evident in
                                their innermost parts and in their faint outer parts.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Furthermore, many elliptical galaxies
                                have slowly varying ellipticity, with the images being more circular in the central regions
                                than in the outer parts. The major axes sometimes do not line up either; their position
                                angles vary in the outer parts. Finally, astronomers have found that a few ellipticals do in
                                fact have small numbers of luminous O and B stars as well as dust lanes.

                                Elliptical galaxies are shaped like stretched-out circles, or ellipses. Some elliptical
                                galaxies are more stretched out than others. One might look almost perfectly circular.
                                Another one might look long and flat. Elliptical galaxies contain mostly older stars. That
                                means they often aren't as bright as spiral galaxies. They also have very little dust and
                                gas. Elliptical galaxies are the largest and most common galaxies observed. They make up
                                about 20% of nearby galaxies.

                                Hubble recognized these two types of irregular galaxies, Irr I and Irr II. The Irr I type is
                                the most common of the irregular systems, and it seems to fall naturally on an extension of
                                the spiral classes, beyond Sc, into galaxies with no discernible spiral structure. They are
                                blue, are highly resolved, and have little or no nucleus. The Irr II systems are red, rare
                                objects. They include various kinds of chaotic galaxies for which there apparently are many
                                different explanations, including most commonly the results of galaxy-galaxy interactions,
